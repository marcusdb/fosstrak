This page explains how to build the Fosstrak middleware module from source


= Details =

Preconditions:
  * Maven 2.2.+ installed
  * subversion installed
  * java runtime installed

Steps:
  * svn checkout https://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fc
  * download the following three dependencies , since they are currently not available from any maven repository (this is a bit painful and we are planning to change this):
    # jargs  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jargs/files/jargs/1.0/jargs-1.0.zip/download
    # javax.comm http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/picdev/software/javaxcomm.zip
    # ltkjava-1.0.0.6 http://sourceforge.net/projects/llrp-toolkit/files/llrp-toolkit/ltkjava/1.0.0.6/ltkjava-1.0.0.6-with-dependencies.jar/download
  * Install each of the three dependencies locally:
{{{
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=<group-id> \
    -DartifactId=<artifact-id> -Dversion=<version> -Dpackaging=<packaging>
}}}
  * mvn package
